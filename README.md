It is now Monday after Thanksgiving break.
I was hoping to get started on this at least a week ago, but that hasn't happened, due to both busy scheduling and procratination. 
My hope is to work on this project every day up until the due date to get it as solid as possible.

For this project, I am going to take the approach of working on the base features first. I want to establish the base features of indexing before I worry about modifying any files.
I'm also going to take the approach of building on other features like I did for the last project. Instead of worrying about having all indexes running at once, im going to work on having one working at once. 
I'm also going to try and keep up with the github as much as possible. I have never kept up with a github, but i'm going to make sure I at least have a commit at the end of each session.
